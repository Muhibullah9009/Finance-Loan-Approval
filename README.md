# Loan Approval Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict loan approval status using historical financial loan application data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning model development.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about loan applicants such as:

- Gender
- Married status
- Dependents
- Education
- Self-employed status
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Property_Area
- Loan_Status (Target)

## 🧪 Workflow Overview

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Missing value treatment
- Handling outliers
- Encoding categorical variables

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution plots (e.g., income, loan amount)
- Relationship analysis (e.g., loan status vs credit history)

### 3. **Model Building**
Two classification models were implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Results

The models were evaluated based on their ability to predict loan approval accurately. The notebook shows performance comparisons between Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier using classification metrics.

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Using advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Feature scaling and cross-validation
